Jupyter Notebook treats this as the root directory, (which it names `/files` as opposed to just `/`). Thus we prefix all our paths with `/files` and can only access files underneath the file-system from wherever Jupyter Notebook was launched. For example `/path/to/tda-d3-explorer/data/bmp/00001.bmp` becomes `/files/data/bmp/00001.bmp` since Jupyter Notebook was launched in `/path/to/tda-d3-explorer`.\n",
